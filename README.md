# INF555 - Constraint-based Modeling and Algorithms for Decision-making

## Repository Overview

This repository contains coursework and exercises from the **INF555** class, focused on constraint-based modeling and decision-making algorithms. The exercises explore various methods and techniques used to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and optimize decision-making processes using constraint programming and related algorithms.

## Topics Covered

- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Backtracking algorithms for CSP
- Heuristic search techniques
- Optimization and decision-making models
- Constraint programming frameworks and libraries

## Purpose

This repository is meant to document the progress and understanding gained through the exercises, serving as a reference for future projects and further exploration of constraint-based modeling and algorithmic decision-making methods.
